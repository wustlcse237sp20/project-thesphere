# cse237-project

To Run Program:

- Eclipse: Open the entire repo folder in Eclipse and run the file "MainUIFrame.java". 

- Terminal: "cd" to the directory that the repo is cloned to, cd into the "src" bin, and run "Java MainUIFrame.java".

- What user stories were completed this iteration?
	
	The basic user interface has been completed as well as the beginning file input/output system used to store user information. Folders named after the user's email are created upon account creation. A "password.txt" file with that user's password is created in that user's directory. The classes for User and Wallet have also been created.

- What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
	
	Next iteration, we intend to complete the back-end logic more thoroughly. The classes we made will be integrated with the file input/output system and the ticketing logic will be working. Login page should be completed. 

- Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
	
	The back-end logic is still in the works; the UI currently works with true/false determiners. Login verification has not yet been implemented but we plan on using our file input/ouput system to verify password.txt file with the text field inputted by the user. Also, object classes are not yet connected.
