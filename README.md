# cse237-project

What user stories were completed this iteration?
	The basic user interface has been completed as well as the SQL database setup. SQL has been integrated with the UI and the classes for User and Wallet have been created.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
	Next iteration, we intend to complete the back-end logic more thoroughly. The classes we made will be integrated with SQL and the ticketing logic will be working.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
	The back-end logic is still in the works; the UI currently works with true/false determiners and SQL and the object classes are not yet connected.
