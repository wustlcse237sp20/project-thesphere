# cse237-project

To Run Program:

- Eclipse: Open the entire repo folder in Eclipse and run the file "MainUIFrame.java". 

- Terminal: "cd" to the directory that the repo is cloned to, cd into the "src" directory, compile MainUIFrame with `javac MainUIFrame.java` and run `java MainUIFrame`.

Iteration 2:

- What user stories were completed this iteration?
	
	The account creation and login logic has been completed and now utilizes the User class to move back end functionality out of the UI class. The UI has been updated with code for ticket purchasing.

- What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
	
	Next iteration, we intend to complete the Event and Ticket classes, which are already started in development branches, to round out the back end support of purchasing tickets. Time permitting we will begin adding functionality to the Wallet class.

- Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
	
	The front-end code for purchasing tickets is in place but there is no back-end code to provide any functionality behind that.

# Project Description
The Sphere is a concert venue; customers can go to our venue's website to view upcoming events and purchase tickets. Users can make an account and see all of their purchased tickets on the account page. The site also includes a points-based reward system: for each ticket purchase, users earn an amount of points that can go towards a discount on following ticket purchases
