# cse237-project

What user stories were completed this iteration?
	The basic user interface has been completed as well as the SQL database setup. SQL has been integrated with the UI and the classes for User and Wallet have been created.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
	Next iteration, we intend to complete the back-end logic more thoroughly. The classes we made will be integrated with SQL and the ticketing logic will be working.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
	The back-end logic is still in the works; the UI currently works with true/false determiners and SQL and the object classes are not yet connected.

The Sphere is a concert venue; customers can go to our venue's website to view upcoming events and purchase tickets. Users can make an account and see all of their purchased tickets on the account page. The site also includes a points-based reward system: for each ticket purchase, users earn an amount of points that can go towards a discount on following ticket purchases
